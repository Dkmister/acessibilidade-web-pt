  <h2>JavaScript Accessibility Issues</h2>

  <p>JavaScript allows developers to add increased interaction, information processing,
    and control in web-based content. However, JavaScript can also introduce accessibility
    issues. These issues may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Navigation. </strong>Inability or difficulty navigating using a keyboard
      or assistive technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Hidden content.</strong> Presentation of content or functionality that
      is not accessible to assistive technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>User control. </strong> Lack of user control over automated content changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Confusion/Disorientation. </strong>Altering or disabling the normal functionality
      of the user agent (browser) or triggering events that the user may not be aware
      of.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A web page containing JavaScript will typically be fully accessible if the functionality
    of the script is device independent (does not require only a mouse or only a
    keyboard) and the information (content) is available to assistive technologies.
    Unfortunately, there is no easy fix that can be applied to solve all accessibility
    problems associated with JavaScript. The only way to ensure JavaScript accessibility
    is by evaluating each pages that utilizes scripting and devising a unique solution
    to any accessibility problem found.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="noimpact">
  <h3>JavaScript that does not impact accessibility</h3>

  <p>Just because JavaScript is utilized on a page does not mean that the page is inaccessible.
    In many cases, JavaScript can be used to increase accessibility. Additional information,
    warnings, or instructions can be given to users through JavaScript prompts. For
    instance, under the <a href="/standards/508/checklist">Section 508 guidelines of United States law</a>    and the <a href="/standards/wcag/checklist">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>,
    a user must be notified when a timed response is required and given sufficient
    time to indicate more time is required. Such functionality would be difficult
    with HTML alone.</p>

  <p>JavaScript is sometimes used to create visual interface elements that do not affect
    accessibility. JavaScript is commonly used for image rollovers or other visual-only
    modifications, where one image is replaced with another when the mouse is placed
    above it; for example, when a navigation item changes to display a shadow, glow,
    or highlight when the user mouses over it.</p>

  <p>Such uses of JavaScript do not need additional accessibility features incorporated
    because important content is not displayed or functionality introduced by such
    scripting.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="reliance">
  <h2>JavaScript Reliance</h2>

  <p>It is a common misconception that people with disabilities don't have or 'do' JavaScript,
    and thus, that it's acceptable to have inaccessible scripted interfaces, so long
    as it is accessible with JavaScript disabled. A 2012 survey by WebAIM of screen
    reader users found that <a href="/projects/screenreadersurvey4/#javascript">98.6% of respondents had JavaScript enabled</a>.
    The numbers are even higher for users with <a href="/projects/lowvisionsurvey/#javascript">low vision</a>    or <a href="projects/motordisabilitysurvey/#javascript">motor disabilities</a>.
    In short, people with disabilities will experience scripting, so scripted content
    must be made natively accessible.</p>

  <p>Accessibility guidelines also require scripted interfaces to be accessible. While
    WCAG 1.0 from 1999 required that pages be functional and accessible with scripting
    disabled, WCAG 2.0 and all other modern guidelines allow you to require JavaScript,
    but the scripted content or interactions must be compliant with the guidelines.</p>

  <p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that some users do disable JavaScript
    or may be using technologies that don't support or fully support scripting. If
    your web page or application requires scripting, ensure that you account for
    users without JavaScript. While this does not necessarily mean that all functionality
    must work without scripting (though this would clearly be optimal), if it does
    not work without scripting, you must avoid a confusing or non-functional presentation
    that may appear to function, but does not because of lack of JavaScript support.</p>

<h1>Accessible Javascript<br><span class="subtitle">JavaScript Event Handlers</span></h1>

<div class="section" id="jsoverview">
  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Event handlers accompany existing HTML code or dynamically generated content and
    are triggered by a browser or user event - such as when the page loads, when
    the user clicks the mouse, or when the time is 8 p.m. Some event handlers are
    dependent upon use of a mouse or keyboard. These are called <strong>device dependent</strong>    event handlers. Other event handlers are <strong>device independent</strong>    and are triggered by both the mouse and keyboard or by other means.</p>

  <div class="important">
    <div class="title">Important</div>
    <p>To ensure accessibility, use either a device independent event handler (one that
      works with both the mouse and the keyboard) or use both mouse dependent <em>and</em>      keyboard dependent event handlers.</p>
  </div>

</div>

<div class="section" id="onmouseover">
  <h2><code>onMouseOver</code> and <code>onMouseOut</code></h2>

  <p>The <code>onMouseOver</code> event handler is triggered when the mouse cursor is
    placed over an item. As its name implies, <code>onMouseOver</code> requires the
    use of a mouse, thus it is a device dependent event handler and may cause accessibility
    issues. <code>onMouseOver</code>, and its companion, <code>onMouseOut</code>,
    may be used, as long as any important content or functionality is also available
    without using the mouse. If the mouse interaction is purely cosmetic (such as
    the addition of a glow or drop shadow), there are likely no accessibility issues,
    so long as the style change does not indicate some function (such as to indicate
    that an element is clickable).</p>

  <p>If the mouse interaction presents additional information or content, such as a
    tooltip, a navigation menu, etc., then this content will not be accessible to
    anyone not using a mouse. Additional considerations are necessary for accessibility.</p>

  <p>For screen reader users, the additional content might be provided directly in an
    accessible way, such as through alternative text, through an ARIA label or description,
    or perhaps through off-screen text. However, for sighted keyboard-only users,
    there must be a mechanism for them to access and view the newly revealed content
    or functionality.</p>

  <p>In addition to <code>onMouseOver</code> and <code>onMouseOut</code>, use <code>onFocus</code>    and <code>onBlur</code>. These actions are triggered when the keyboard is used
    to navigate to and from an element. Of course these can only be triggered on
    keyboard-navigable elements - links and form controls (or perhaps elements with
    <a href="/techniques/keyboard/tabindex">tabindex</a>). Simply triggering the
    change with a standard link and using both mouse and keyboard dependent event
    handlers will help ensure accessibility.</p>

  <p>Sometimes scripting is used to present complex interactions, such as a drop-down
    or fly-out menu. While these can be made technically accessible, sometimes an
    accessible alternative approach may be more friendly. For example, instead of
    forcing users to navigate through a complex and lengthy navigation menu, you
    could instead ensure that the menu system is NOT directly keyboard accessible
    (nor read by a screen reader), but provide standard link functionality on the
    top-level menu item (e.g., "Products"). This link would take the user to a secondary
    page that provides standard links to the pages provided through the complex menu
    (e.g., a Products landing page that has links to the various product categories).
    While not exactly the same interaction that mouse users may choose, such alternatives
    are often more intuitive and friendly for all users.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="onfocus">
  <h2><code>onFocus</code> and <code>onBlur</code></h2>

  <p>These event handlers are typically used with form elements, such as text fields,
    radio buttons, and submit buttons, but can also be used with links. <code>onFocus</code>    is triggered when the cursor is placed on or within a specific form element,
    or when a user 'tabs' to the element using the keyboard. <code>onBlur</code>    is triggered when the cursor leaves a form element or the user 'tabs' away from
    it.</p>

  <p>Both of these event handlers are device independent, meaning that they can be performed
    with the mouse, keyboard, or other assistive technology. The actions that are
    performed as a result of these event handlers must be analyzed to determine if
    they cause accessibility problems. Typically, these events do not cause accessibility
    issues unless they are modifying the default behavior of the web browser or are
    interfering with keyboard navigation within the web page. Examples of such issues
    might be automatically setting focus to other page areas with <code>onFocus</code>    and <code>onBlur</code>, trapping the user inside a form control, dynamically
    revealing form controls immediately upon a user leaving (blurring) a form control,
    etc. Keyboard and screen reader testing will be necessary to ensure these interactions
    are built in an accessible manner.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="onclick">
  <h2><code>onClick</code> and <code>onDblClick</code></h2>

  <p>The <code>onClick</code> event handler is triggered when the mouse is pressed when
    over an HTML element. <code>onClick</code> is intended to be a mouse dependent
    event handler. However, if the <code>onClick</code> event handler is used with
    keyboard-navigable links or form controls, then most major browsers and assistive
    technologies trigger <code>onClick</code> if the <span class="keycap">Enter</span>    key is pressed when the link or control has focus. In these cases, <code>onClick</code>    is a device independent event handler.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the <span class="keycap">Enter</span> key will not always trigger
    the <code>onClick</code> event if it is used with non-link and non-control elements,
    such as plain text, table cells, or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, even if
    they made keyboard navigable using tabindex or are focused using scripting. In
    these cases, it will be necessary to detect the <span class="keycap">Enter</span>    and <span class="keycap">Space</span> key presses while focus is placed on them.</p>

  <p>The <code>onDblClick</code> event handler is associated with the double click of
    a mouse on a selected HTML element. There is no device independent or keyboard
    equivalent to <code>onDblClick</code>, so it must be avoided.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="onchange">
  <h2><code>onChange</code> and <code>onSelect</code></h2>

  <p>The <code>onChange</code> event handler is triggered when a form element is selected
    and changed, for example, when a radio button is initially selected, when the
    text changes within a text box or text area, or when the active item in a select
    menu changes. Although these event handlers are device independent and can be
    activated using the mouse, keyboard, or other device, the actions that are performed
    as a result of these event handlers must be analyzed to determine if they cause
    accessibility problems.</p>

  <p>A common use of <code>onChange</code> is on select menus to trigger navigation
    when the active option within the menu is changed. These menus can cause keyboard
    accessibility issues because you cannot scroll through the list using a keyboard
    without selecting one of the options, and thus triggering the <code>onChange</code>    event. Some browsers (including Firefox) override these jump menus so they are
    not activated on keyboard change, but only after you either select an item using
    a mouse or press Enter if using the keyboard. However, these types of JavaScript
    'jump' menus can be made keyboard accessible by removing <code>onChange</code>    and providing a submit button separate from the list of choices that activates
    the currently selected item.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="deviceindependent">
  <h2>Using Device Independent Event Handlers</h2>

  <p>Several event handlers are device independent, including <code>onFocus</code>,
    <code>onBlur</code>, <code>onSelect</code>, <code>onChange</code>, and <code>onClick</code>    (when <code>onClick</code> is used with link or form elements). When possible,
    use device independent event handlers. Other event handlers are device dependent,
    meaning that they rely wholly upon a certain type of input. For instance, <code>onMouseOver</code>,
    <code>onMouseOut</code>, and <code>onDblClick</code> rely upon the use of a mouse.
    There are also some event handlers that are dependent upon use of the keyboard
    (<code>onKeyDown</code>, <code>onKeyUp</code>, etc.). Multiple device dependent
    event handlers can be used together to allow both mouse and keyboard activation
    of JavaScript, but this requires testing across different browsers and assistive
    technologies to ensure that accessibility is not limited in any way.</p>

<h1>Accessible Javascript<br><span class="subtitle">Other Issues</span></h1>

<div class="section" id="dynamic">
  <h2>Dynamic Content and Accessibility</h2>

  <p>CSS and JavaScript are sometimes used to display, hide, or move information based
    upon input from the user or pre-programmed commands. This is sometimes called
    Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Most drop-down or fly-out menus or other types of rich
    interactions involve scripting. Because most of these elements are modified based
    upon mouse input, they are typically inaccessible to users who do not use a mouse.
    When dynamic content and interactions is used, two items must be evaluated to
    determine its impact on accessibility:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Is the event used to trigger a change device independent? If the mouse is required,
      then it is not fully accessible.</li>
    <li>Is the dynamic content or functionality itself accessible? If assistive technologies
      cannot adequately access dynamically triggered content or functionality, then
      it is not fully accessible.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="section" id="write">
  <h2>JavaScript Generated Content</h2>

  <p>Content generated by JavaScript, such as through <code>document.write</code> or
    other functions is generally accessible to assistive technologies. In some cases,
    however, if the dynamic content is constantly changing or if it changes while
    the user is reading it or has set focus to it, this can interfere with navigation
    or browser functionality and cause accessibility problems. For example, if an
    element that has keyboard focus is significantly changed, hidden, or removed
    from the page, keyboard focus may revert to the very beginning of the page.</p>

  <p>When using dynamic information, you must first ask yourself if it is necessary
    and vital to the function or content of the page. If so, there is often a way
    to provide the content without using inaccessible JavaScript. For instance, ensuring
    that the dynamic content is generated via user command or interaction, rather
    than automatically or randomly, can ensure that the content does not change when
    it is focused or being read.</p>

  <p>Additionally, sometimes dynamic content needs to receive keyboard focus. For example,
    a dialog box that appears will likely need to be given focus (using JavaScript
    <code>focus()</code>) after it appears to ensure it is navigated or read immediately.
    Additional techniques may be necessary to ensure accessibility for such dynamic
    elements - a modal dialog, for example, may need to be programmed to maintain
    keyboard focus (rather than allowing focus into other parts of the page that
    are not available).</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="popups">
  <h2>Pop-up Windows</h2>

  <p>Pop-up windows provide a unique accessibility concern. First of all, most usability
    experts would argue against the use of pop-up windows except in extreme cases.
    For a visual user, it may be difficult to notice and navigate to the new window
    or tab. For someone who is using assistive technologies, the new window may be
    annoying and confusing because the default behavior for the link has been modified.
    JavaScript implementation may make the new window difficult or impossible to
    resize or scale for someone using a screen enlarger. For someone who is blind,
    there is typically an indication that a new window has opened, but it may be
    burdensome to then return back to the original page. When the screen reader user
    attempts to return to the previous page by selecting the back button, it may
    be confusing to find that this does not work.</p>

  <p>When using JavaScript to open new windows, you can modify the size and position
    of the new window. You can also add or remove functionality of the window, such
    as the ability to resize, display scroll bars, show tool bars, etc. Be very careful
    when changing the default behavior of the browser window. If a user has low vision
    and must enlarge the content, a small window that cannot be enlarged and does
    not display scroll bars would be very inaccessible. Someone with a motor disability
    may rely upon large tool bars to accurately control the web browser, so removing
    or modifying them may introduce difficulties for this user.</p>

  <p>As you can see, there are many difficulties in both usability and accessibility
    that arise through the use of pop-up windows. Care must be taken in making the
    decision to use them. If they are used, thorough user testing of your implementation
    is vital to ensure accessibility. It is generally best to alert the user to the
    fact that a pop-up window will be opened.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="redirecting">
  <h2>Redirecting and Refreshing Browser Windows</h2>

  <p>When the page the browser is viewing suddenly changes or refreshes, the person
    viewing that page may become disoriented or confused, especially if that person
    is using an assistive technology. This is commonly done with page redirects when
    page content has been moved or updated, or with scripting or <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>    tags to refresh pages automatically. Accessibility guidelines requires that users
    be given control over time sensitive content changes. Do not automatically change
    or refresh the browser window without first alerting the user that the change
    will occur and giving him/her the ability to disable or postpone the change,
    or even better, give the user full control over the page change or redirect.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="css">
  <h2>Using Pure CSS as a JavaScript Alternative</h2>

  <p>As mentioned previously, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parameters are often modified
    using JavaScript to create dynamically changing content. However, much of the
    dynamic functionality often controlled with JavaScript is now available directly
    within the specifications for CSS itself. This allows the construction of interactive
    and dynamic navigation and layout elements without the need for JavaScript events.
    You can create drop-down menus, interactive images, animation, and other exciting
    features in web sites without worrying about device dependent event handlers.</p>

  <p>It's important to note that CSS is intended for visual styling. As such, screen
    readers largely ignore CSS. It should not generally be used to present content
    or functionality, at least not without ensuring the content or functionality
    is fully accessible. Using CSS alone to produce dynamic content should only employed
    with much testing in a variety of browsers and screen readers.</p>
</div>

<h1>Accessible Javascript<br><span class="subtitle">JavaScript Alternatives</span></h1>

<div class="section" id="intro">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Whenever JavaScript cannot be made directly accessible, an accessible alternative
    must be provided. Also, some user agents, such as web-enabled cell phones, tablets,
    and other mobile devices, do not yet fully utilize JavaScript. There are several
    ways you can provide accessible alternatives when the scripting cannot be made
    accessible or when the end user does not have JavaScript enabled.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="serverside">
  <h2>Server-side Processing</h2>

  <p>In many cases, the functionality provided by JavaScript can or should be duplicated
    by server-side scripting. For example, JavaScript is often used to validate form
    elements before a form is posted. Instead of implementing such JavaScript programming
    and its accompanying accessibility techniques, you could use a server-side script
    to validate the form elements. Because scripting can always be disabled or modified
    by the end user, it should never be relied on for critical form validation or
    other functions. JavaScript is often used to write dynamic information to a web
    page, such as the current date and/or time. Again, using a server script or include
    negates the need for additional accessibility implementation.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="progressive">
  <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>

  <p>Progressive enhancement is the technique of using scripting to enhance the functionality
    or behavior of content and functionality that is already sufficient without scripting.
    An example might be adding client-side <a href="/techniques/formvalidation/">form validation and error recovery</a>    to a form that already has server-side validation. The form still functions fine
    without scripting, but the scripting progressively enhances the form to make
    it more usable and accessible. This is an excellent approach to developing accessible
    scripted interfaces - first start with accessible markup and core HTML (and perhaps
    server-side) functionality, then add accessible scripting to make it more efficient,
    friendly, and accessible.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="noscript">
  <h2><code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code></h2>

  <p>Making JavaScript natively accessible is very important. However, in some cases,
    the end user may not have JavaScript enabled or may be using technologies that
    do not support JavaScript. In such cases, you can provide non-JavaScript alternatives
    to user's who cannot or choose not to view JavaScript content.</p>

  <p>When JavaScript is used within a Web page, the most straightforward way to provide
    an alternative for the JavaScript-generated content is to provide content within
    the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>    element can be used within your page to display content in browsers that do not
    support or have disabled JavaScript. However, if JavaScript IS enabled the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>    element is ignored.</p>

  <div class="important">
    <div class="title">Important</div>

    <p>Providing an accessible alternative within the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>      element for an inaccessible script will not make the page accessible. The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>      content will only display if JavaScript is disabled. Most screen reader users
      have JavaScript enabled, and will thus encounter your inaccessible script and
      not the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> content. <strong>In other words, <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> is an alternative to scripting, NOT an alternative for inaccessibility.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <p>Optimally, the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> element would contain equivalent or
    alternative content or functionality to the scripted content or functionality.
    You may, for example, provide a link to an accessible HTML alternative or to
    a page that utilizes server-side scripting instead. However, this is often not
    possible, especially for highly complex applications that cannot be duplicated
    without scripting. In these cases you may choose to simply indicate "Your browser
    does not support JavaScript." or similar. This does nothing to make the content
    accessible or usable, but at least conveys why it is not accessible or usable.</p>

  <p>Progressive enhancement can also be used to provide JavaScript alternatives or,
    at a minimum, failure messages for when scripting is not available. For example,
    an error message or link to an alternative version may be provided in HTML at
    the beginning of the page, but if scripting is enabled, it is used to hide this
    message from view using CSS <code>display:none;</code>. Users without scripting
    enabled will see the message, but users with scripting will not.</p>

</div>
